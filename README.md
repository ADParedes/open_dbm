## OpenDBM 

OpenDBM is a software package that allows for calculation of digital 
biomarkers of health and functioning from video or audio of an individualâ€™s 
behavior. It integrates existing tools for behavioral measurements such as
facial activity, voice, and movement into a single package for measurement 
of overall behavior.

**For installation and use instructions, see the [wiki](https://github.com/AiCure/open_dbm/wiki).**
