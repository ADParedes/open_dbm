## OpenDBM 

OpenDBM is a software package that allows for calculation of digital 
biomarkers of health and functioning from video or audio of an individualâ€™s 
behavior. It integrates existing tools for measurement of behavioral 
characteristics such as facial activity, voice, and movement into a single 
package for measurement of overall behavior.
